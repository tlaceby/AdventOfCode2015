# advent-of-code-2015

This is my code repository for the 2015 Advent Of Code programming challenges.  At the start of these challenges I had not written any Rust before but wanted to learn. I learened of this website and figured it was a good set of challenges to dive into Rust and learn.

Plus in the future It would be fun to actually compete as the events live.
