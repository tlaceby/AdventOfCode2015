# advent-of-code-2015

This is my code repository for the 2015 Advent Of Code programming challenges.  At the start of these challenges I had not written any Rust before but wanted to learn. I fdiscovered the Advent Of Code through youtube and determined it was a good set of challenges to dive into Rust and learn. Hopefully throught the set of challenges I can lookback and see the improvement in my understanding of the Rust programming language.
